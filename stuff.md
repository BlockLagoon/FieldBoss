**﻿My background:**  Having been a GIS analyst/developer for most of my career, I have an interest and aptitude for working with digital information in a spatial context.  Within the last two years I have been focusing on learning blockchain and web3 technology and can see the potential for developing dapps that integrate location geometries into NFTs for use in mapping applications and the metaverse.  With this project, I am developing a use case for such and idea.

**My inspiration for this project:**  I have an interest in the metaverse and have wanted to purchase a virtual plot on which I can design and build a structure.  But I quickly discovered that the price of a plot in a desireable metaverse neighborhood (eg. decentralland) is much more than Iâ€™m willing to spend.  A metaverse has two consistent traits: a visual interface and a coordinate system.  Knowing this, I came up with an idea to build virtual spaces in the metaverse by creating composite 3d NFT pods on the XRP Ledger that float above the surface.  These pods are called MetaScapes.
