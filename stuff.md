**ï»¿My background:**  Having been a GIS analyst/developer for most of my career, I have an interest and aptitude for working with digital information in a spatial context.  Within the last two years I have been focusing on learning blockchain and web3 technology and can see the potential for developing dapps that integrate location geometries into NFTs for use in mapping applications and the metaverse.  With this project, I am developing a use case for such and idea.

**My inspiration for this project:**  I have an interest in the metaverse and have wanted to purchase a virtual plot on which I can design and build a structure.  But I quickly discovered that the price of a plot in a desireable metaverse neighborhood (eg. decentralland) is much more than I am willing to spend.  A metaverse has two consistent traits: a visual interface and a coordinate system.  Knowing this, I came up with an idea to build virtual spaces in the metaverse by creating composite 3d NFT pods on the XRP Ledger that float above the surface.  These pods are called MetaScapes.

**Future Possibilities:**  This project is really just a starting point for exploring composite NFTs in the metaverse. Additional tools can be built that extend MetaScapes providing capabilities yet to be developed. Here are some ideas:

The location of individual child tokens can be moved or ownership can be transferred

The location of an entire pod can be moved or ownership transferred

Child tokens can be added or deleted from the master pod

Child tokens can be animated in real time

Digital twin data sources can become 3d pods

Using hooks, composite NFTs can receive external data via oracles and emit a response

Composite NFT pods can be created at a micro scale which when combined with AI could provide new ways to use the metaverse
